Hi there, thanks for reading.

The purpose of this application is to show what I learned about Flutter. 
The idea behind the app is digitalizing registration process in our local dirt racing competition.
App is still "work in progress", but mostly functional.
Fresh edit: Now that I learned more about Flutter I realize how much of a hot mess this app is and that my state management is absolute garbage.
Don't know if it's worth fixing this app or just build some new app as a showcase of my "knowledge".

**Edit-edit: After todays reassessment, I realized this whole thing is a pile of garbage code and needs to be rewritten from scratch. Since the theme of this project is about local racing competition, I'll start rewriting this as soon as I finish the project car I would be racing with.**
